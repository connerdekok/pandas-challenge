Title- Homework Module 4 Pandas Challenge- Conner Dekok

Collaboration with other students- I collaborated with Hunter Becker and Nicholas Fussy on comparing results we got during this assignment to help verify the results we had gotten. I reviewed a few of our in-class activities to help find information on where to start with my code when working on this assignment.

I had taken some of our in class examples and the code that was given to us to complete this assignment. 

I also corrected a couple of bugs and issues that occured in my code with Microsoft Copilot Ai to help debug my code when I had issues occur. 


Written Report-  
The data provided from the data sets help show a variety of different conclusions that can be applied to how the schools have operated. For example, the schools with a higher per student budget ended up performing worse than the schools with a lower total budget in terms of the percentage of overall students who had passed. As an example, Bailey High School had a per student budget of $628.00, and a percentage of overall passing students of 54.64%. While Cabera High School had a per student budget of $582.00 and an overall passing rate of 91.33%. This data helps to summarize that just because schools have a higher budget does not necessarily mean that their students will perform better, and that there can be other factors involved such as the size of the school and number of teachers present. 
	Another piece of information that can be taken from the data is comparing the difference between the types of schools. Charters schools outperformed district schools in every testing category. For example, charter schools had a 90.43% passing rate while district only had a 53.67% pass rate.  Also, when comparing the school sizes, the small and medium sized schools outperformed the large schools when it came to the percentage of overall passing students. Small schools had an overall pass rate of 89.88%, medium schools had a 90.62% pass rate, and large schools had a pass rate of 58.28%. This could occur due to there being more teachers per number of students at the small and medium schools compared to the large schools. 

	In summary, this data set shows that charter schools outperformed district schools in every single testing category, the district schools could research other factors that charter schools are doing to help improve test scores such as teaching practices and homework strategies to help increase their testing scores.  The district schools could take more testing practices and teaching concepts from the charter schools to help improve their students scores.
